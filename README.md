# SNP Scout

This is a demonstration project for CSE 185. `SNP Scout` implements a simpler version of the SNP caller available through VarScan. See the [VarScan](https://varscan.sourceforge.net/using-varscan.html) page for more details.  
# Install Instructions
No additional libraries are required for installation. 
To install `SNP Scout`, access the directory where you want to install the tool and use the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/MufeiL/SNP_Scout 
```
Then, change into the SNP_Scout directory and install the tool. You can use the following commands:
```
cd SNP_Scout
```
```
pip install .
```
If your installation was successful, typing ``snp_scout --help`` in any directory should print a helpful message. Otherwise, you may need to specify the path for the package. You can do this with the following command:
```
export PATH=$PATH:/home/$USER/.local/bin
```
# Basic Usage
The basic usage of `SNP Scout` is given by the following:
```
snp_scout [-m min-freq] [-c min-coverage] [-o output file path] mpileup file
```
To run `SNP Scout` on a small test dataset, use the following command in the SNP_Scout directory:
```
snp_scout example-files/test_short_mpileup.txt -c 1
```
This should produce the following output:
```
#CHROM  POS     REF     ALT     FORMAT  SAMPLE1
chrTEST 10      C       G       GT      0/1
chrTEST 13      A       T       GT      1/1
```
# SNP Scout Options
The only required input to `SNP Scout` is a SAMtools pileup file. Users can specify additional options below:
* `-m FREQ`, `--min_var_freq FREQ`: minimum variant allele frequency threshold. By default, 0.01 is used.
* `-c COV`, `--min_coverage COV`: minimum read depth at a position to make a call for variants. By default, 8 is used.
* `-o FILE`, `--out FILE`: write output to the specified file. Otherwise, output is written to the terminal.   
# File Format 
The output file format is the same as the VarScan variant calling method. See the [VarScan](https://varscan.sourceforge.net/using-varscan.html) page for more details.
